<p>User research has been the talk of the industry in recent years. However, in addition to user research, we find it also important to look at the problem from a wider perspective and understand the market and trend. We call this design research. Imagine a goat being chased by a lion on a vast grasslands. The role of a user researcher is to observe the scene up close from behind a rock while a designer researcher stands on a hill trying to discern the balance in the food chain. </p>
<p>Our project team is made up of both user and design researchers. Throughout the expedition, their most important role is to validate user needs and match market demands. </p>
