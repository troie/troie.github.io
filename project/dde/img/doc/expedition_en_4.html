<p>Often, businesses see others’ success as mere luck. Having a great hit sometimes does require a bit of luck; however, we believe, in the product development process, doing solid user testing and validation will increase the chance of success. </p>
<p>Scientists and engineers have long embrace the concept of prototyping and testing. They test low-cost prototypes to ensure feasibility before putting a product into production. This approach has also been adopted by the business world. We breakdown a new concept into multiple parts and validate user needs separately. This will not only allow us to understand users’ feedback towards each part of the idea, but also lower the risk of leaking the entire plan.</p>
