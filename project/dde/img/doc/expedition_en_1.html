<p>In this world where everything seems to be dominated by technology, it is interesting to still see high levels of interest around classic cars and antiques. We noticed that the biggest bottleneck in many companies originated from the desire to over invest in pursuing new technologies. In the other hand, they have little idea on how their technologies would become an integral part of people’s lives. </p>
<p>These companies don’t find ways to understand user needs and create emotional bond with the them.</p>
<p>In collaboration with our clients, we find balance in technology and design to create solution(s) that matches the needs of users. </p>
