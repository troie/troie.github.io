<p>Our vision is to help businesses build innovation skills that enables employees to become better problem solvers. To ensure full mastery and quality of work, we not only are a part of the project team but also act as coaches to other team members. Often, at the beginning, project members from clients’ team have a difficult time adjusting their mentality to become user-centered. Having participated in the expedition, they realized the value in listening to user feedback. They apply this mindset to their daily work and lead teams in future innovation effort. The majority of our clients kept the original team. Some even expanded the team and strengthen the innovation culture within the company.</p>
