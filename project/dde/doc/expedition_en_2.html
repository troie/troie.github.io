<h3>用戶需求與設計趨勢研究</h3>

<p>User research has become a staple in the industry. It serves its purpose well but improvements can be made. <em>We think it is important to look at a problem from a wider perspective and understand the market and trends.</em> This is where design research comes in. If user research looks at why a lion preys on a goat, then design research looks at where the lion and goat belong on the food chain. <em>Each method of research complements the other and together they reach a balanced solution.</em> Our project team is made up of both user and design researchers. Throughout the expedition, their most important role is to validate user needs and match market demands. </p>
