<p>While luck is certainly helpful, it cannot be depended on. We believe solid user testing and validation will increase the chance of success. Scientists and engineers have proven the importance of prototyping and testing by using low-cost prototypes to guarantee feasibility before putting a product into production. This method has been adopted by the business world and modified to ensure privacy. <em>We breakdown a new concept into multiple parts and validate user needs separately. This allows us to understand users’ feedback towards each part of the idea and lowers the risk of leaking the entire plan.</em></p>
