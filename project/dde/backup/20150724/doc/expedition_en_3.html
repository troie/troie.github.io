<p>When doing research, we often do additional work to look into other industries to find inspirations. In our experience, doing so often help to think outside of the box and obtain insights that will otherwise be unattainable. In our work with Asia Miles whose goal is to increase the number of memberships for their royalty program, we noticed that street vendors are able to immediately grab customers’ interest. Therefore, we interviewed Mr. Lu, a successful vendor who owns several booths in various parts of Hong Kong, and obtained insightful tips on sales strategies. His input helped us create a brand new membership recruitment process. Within two years of the launch, Asia Miles’ membership increased by 250%.</p>
