<p>Executives look for effective training programs with low time commitment. Human resources department needs make it interesting for the attendees and strengthen team bonding. We answered all that with our innovation workshop. In the workshop, attendees are grouped in interdisciplinary teams to participate in hands-on drills. These are exercises for teams to learn the right mindsets and approaches to develop innovative solutions. To date, we have worked with Kimberly Clark, Cathay Pacific Airways, Asia Miles, the Far Eastern Group, and more. The scale goes from 20 people to 200. In the case with Asia Miles, clients implemented the concept generated during the workshop and successfully saved millions in operational cost. </p>
