<p>The importance of communication skills is often overlooked in the innovation process. We noticed that during the presentation of a new concept, people often focus on explaining the functionality and execution but fail to clearly and succinctly articulate the vision. Without a core purpose, it is difficult for users to relate to the solution and form attachment. Starting with why allows the audience to obtain the big picture and often deliver a better result in influencing buyers’ purchasing decision. Through sharing effective storytelling and presentation techniques, we assist clients to not only think differently but also talk differently.</p>
